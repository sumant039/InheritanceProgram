Inheritance
Inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism are the four fundamental concepts provided by OOP (Object Oriented Programming). 
Inheritance is a powerful feature of OOP that allows programmers to enable a new class to receive - or inherit all the properties & methods of existing class/classes.
As we all came to know that class is a blueprint or template of an object. Every object is built from a class, and the concept 'inheritance' is used to create a relationship between these blueprints. 
It is a feature of object-oriented programming which is used to define a new class with little or no modification to an existing class.
The new class is called derived class or child class & the class from which this derived class has been inherited is the base class or parent class.
The derived class is formed from base class plus it may include some extra additional features.
This inheritance concept helps to reuse the code. 

Example of Inheritance
Three Ways of Parent-child Class Interaction
When programmers use this type of object-oriented concepts and reuse codes, there are three ways a parent and a child class can interact with each other. 
These are: 
Anything did to the child class simply an action on the parent class.
Actions done on child-class overrides the actions done on parent-class.
Anything done on the child-class alters the action done in the parent class
